# Site Starter Template

A repository to clone whenever I start a new project or want to fiddle around with something.
Whenever I start I tend to set everything up the same way and it wastes a lot of time.
This repository gives me a starting point so I can jump right into the good stuff.
I will keep it up to date with newer versions of things and new lint rules I adapt into my work.

## Tools Included

- SCSS
- Stylelint
- Image Compression

## Future changes

- Javascript folder
- ES6 support
- ESLint
