# Site Starter Template

A repository to clone whenever I start a new project or want to fiddle around with something.
Whenever I want to fiddle around with something on the web I often have to set up the folder in the same way ever time.
I will keep it up to date with newer versions of things and lint rules I adapt into my work.
Will include javascript at some point.

## Tools Included

- SCSS
- Stylelint
- Image Compression

## Future changes

- Javascript folder
- ES6 support
- ESLint
